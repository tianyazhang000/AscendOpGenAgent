## What I do

Generate PyBind bindings for AscendC operator, install the operate run file and evaluate operator correctness against reference implementations.

## When to use me

Use this when you need to evaluate operator correctness against reference implementations.

## Workflow
1. install `custom_opp_ubuntu_aarch64.run` file.
2. generate pybind and install the whl(run generate_pybind.py)
3. evaluate operator correctness

### install run file
 It usually locates in `output/{op_name}/{op_name}Custom/build_out/` dir.
 You must only use --install-path=`output/{op_name}` to run it. And you must use absolute path for --install-path argument.

### generate pybind
You need to run `generate_pybind.py`, it will generate pybind whl and use pip to install this whl. Get the console output of the executed script and print it.

Usage:
```shell
python3 .opencode/skills/ascendc_evalution/scripts/generate_pybind.py <op_name>
```

### evaluate operator correctness
You need to run `evaluate.py` to evaluate the correctness of the operator. It sets environment variables `ASCEND_CUSTOM_OPP_PATH`, adds `.so` file path in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and evaluates the correctness.

Usage:
```shell
python3 .opencode/skills/ascendc_evalution/scripts/evaluate.py <op_name>
```

Console output:
- result of correctness
    - pass: result of performance
    - fail: correctness fail message

### evaluate performance
Perform the operation only after the correctness is successful. You need to run `benchmark.py` to evaluate the performance. It sets environment variables `ASCEND_CUSTOM_OPP_PATH`, adds `.so` file path in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and evaluates the performance.

Usage:
```shell
python3 .opencode/skills/ascendc_evalution/scripts/performance.py  \
    --op_name <op_name> \
    --verify_dir <input path> \
    --warmup <number of warmup> \
    --repeats <number of repeats> \
    --output <ouput path>
```

Console output:
- result of performance
    - pass: result of performance
    - fail: correctness fail message
